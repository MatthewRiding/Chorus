    Computes an elastic wave reflectivity image via the delay-and-sum imaging algorithm known as the Total Focussing
    Method (TFM) (see Holmes, Caroline, Bruce W. Drinkwater, and Paul D. Wilcox. "Post-processing of the full matrix of
    ultrasonic transmitâ€“receive array data for non-destructive evaluation." NDT & e International 38.8 (2005):
     701-711.).

    Params:
    -------
    :param full_matrix: FullMatrixLinearPeriodic
        An instance of the FullMatrixLinearPeriodic class containing the full matrix displacement, time and sampling
        information.
    :param tfm_constructor: TFMConstructor
        An instance of the TFMConstructor class containing all the data regarding the desired TFM image.
    :param signal_progress: Signal, optional
        A Qt Signal that can be emitted to communicate progress information back to the main GUI thread of a PySide6
        application.  An instance of any class that supports '.emit()' can be passed for use outside a GUI framework.
    :param worker_id: str, optional
        A unique uuid for this TFM calculation, used to identify progress signals sent back to the Chorus
        GUI thread during parallel processing.  Can be replaced

    Returns:
    -------
    :return: (summed_displacement_image_complex_nm: ndarray of complex128, displacements_3d_filtered: ndarray)
        The delay-and-sum image.  The complex form is returned for optional envelope processing down-stream.
        The 3d array of filtered displacements is also returned for reference.
